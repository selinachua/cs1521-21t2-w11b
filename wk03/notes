SIGNED INTEGERS 
- first bit tells us the sign
- 0: positive
- 1: negative

TWOS COMPLEMENT 
- mathematical operation 
- gets the negative representation of a value in binary
Steps:
1. Flip all the bits (negate)
2. Add 1

CREATING MASKS
1. starting at 1, left shifting as needed 
0000...0001 -> 1 
0000...0010
0000...0100 
int mask = 1;
every iteration -> mask = mask << 1;

0001...0000
int mask = 1 << x;

2. Use hexadecimal
mask = 0101 1010
     = 0x5A
